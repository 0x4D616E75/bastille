# TODO

This is just a place to throw down the ideas of things I need to fix and or
improve. In no particular order.

+ Consolidate the commands into a single `bastille` cmd.
+ Modular design for imported `bastille` functionality (ie; pkg, cmd, sysrc)
+ ZFS or UFS support
+ `bastille create` needs to support `fetch` fallback
+ `bastille create` needs to support branches
+ `bastille bootstrap` needs a complete review
+ New commands: `sysrc`, `fstab`, `jls`, `git`, `update`, `upgrade`
+ Support for multi-jail templating (create, snapshot, deploy)
+ jail.conf validation support in `create`
+ Dynamic config support for templating
+
